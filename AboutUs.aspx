            About PHOTO CREATIVE<br />
            PHOTO CREATIVE, is about more than just photography, at the very least, we are about creating art, 
            through photography. Our studio is a professional photography studio and gallery located in Skopje, GTC. 
            Our studio encompasses no less than 9 different photography genres, each focusing on a specific look, and 
            each with it's own style. If you are ready to learn more about our photography and artwork, 
            I would encourage you to read our testimonials, and invite you to explore our website, or better still, 
            come into the studio for a no obligation studio consult, and find out what it's really all about.
            Open Monday through Saturday, by appointment.
